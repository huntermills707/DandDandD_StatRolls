    "### Theory \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the theory behind how stat statistics are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Average\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu = E[X] = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Var(X) = E\\left[\\left( X - \\mu \\right)^2 \\right] $$\n",
    "$$ StandardDeviation = \\sqrt{Var(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Skewness(X) = \\frac{E\\left[\\left( X - \\mu \\right)^3 \\right]}{Var(X)^{3/2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurtosis\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Kurtosis(X) = \\frac{E\\left[\\left( X - \\mu \\right)^4 \\right]}{Var(X)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating metrics corresponding to individual stats, this code iterates over all possible rolls. Assuming a dice $D$ has $m$ sides where $s(i)$ is the value on the $i^{th}$ side of $D$, a dice can be represented as the following set:\n",
    "$$ D_i \\in \\{s_i(1), s_i(2), \\dots, s_i(m)\\} $$\n",
    "Now, a specific stat can be represented as an aggregation $f$ of a series of $n$ rolls where dice $D_i$ are each rolled once:\n",
    "$$ X = \\{ f(v_1,v_2,\\dots,v_n) : v_i \\in D_i \\} $$\n",
    "The number of possible outcomes ($n$):\n",
    "$$ n = |X| = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left|D_i\\right| $$\n",
    "The probability of getting a specific stat can be written as:\n",
    "$$ p_s(i) = \\frac{\\sum \\mathbf{1}_{\\{i\\}}(X)}{n} $$\n",
    "Where $\\mathbf{1}_{A}(x) $ the indicator function defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x):={\\begin{cases}1~&{\\text{ if }}~x\\in A~,\\\\0~&{\\text{ if }}~x\\notin A~.\\end{cases}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Different aggregations are possible. Currently, two aggregations are implemented:\n",
    "1. Keep all Rolls: $f(X) =\\sum X$\n",
    "2. Drop Lowest m Rolls: $f(X) = \\sum X - \\sum\\min_m X$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cumulative Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating cumulative stats\n",
    "$$ Y = \\{ x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_z : x_i \\in X_i \\} $$\n",
    "Where there are $z$ stats calculated. For D&D, there are 6 stats rolled, but in the case of dropping lowest stats, extra stats must be rolled. In this case, there are $|Y|$ possible outcomes: \n",
    "$$ |Y| = n^z$$\n",
    "In the case of 6 stats with 16 possible values (3-18), there are ~16 million possible outcomes. Too Big! To speed up computer time, itrate over combinations (with replacement).\n",
    "$$ C_R(n,r) = \\left({n \\choose r}\\right) = \\frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n-1)!} $$\n",
    "For 6 stats with 16 possible values, there are 54264 combinations with replacement (better!). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when iterating over combinations, probabilities will need to be adjusted by the permutations for each combination, and roll probabilities of the permutation. With $S$ as the set of all combinations, the number of permutations $h$ can be calculated as:\n",
    "$$ h(S_i) = n!\\prod_{j=1}^n \\left( \\sum \\mathbf{1}_{\\{j\\}}(S_i) \\right) !^{-1} $$\n",
    "And the probability of specific combination $p_c$ can be calculated as:\n",
    "$$ p_c(i) = \\frac{h(S_i)}{C_R(n,r)} \\prod_{\\forall j \\in S_i} p_s(j) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the number of stats rolled, different filters are possible. Currently, three filters are implemented:\n",
    "1. Keep all Stats: $g(Y) = Y$\n",
    "2. Drop Lowest m Stats: $g(Y) = Y - \\min_m Y$\n",
    "3. Replace Lowest Stat with k: $g(Y) = Y - \\min Y + \\{k\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can now calculate our metrics as:\n",
    "$$ E[g(Y)] = \\sum_{\\forall i \\in S} p_c(i) \\sum g(Y_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probabilities of Individual Values And Cumulative Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all probabilities are stored, probabilities of cumulated stats can be calculated by adding the probabilities for all combinations that sum to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, probabilities can be calculated similarly. by adding the probabilities of all combinations containing a roll and normalize for the number of stats in each combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are plotted.\n"
