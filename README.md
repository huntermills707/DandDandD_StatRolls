## Dungeon and Dragons Stat Simulator

There are many variations of house rules in regard to stat generation in Dungeons and Dragons.
Each variant has a different effect on how stats are distributed among PCs and NPCs assuming the stats are generated randomly (IE not via point buy). These house rules can have a significant effect on game play because these stats directly effect in game roll modifiers. Some variants may be highly variable, so some PCs could be significantly weaker than others. This could be fun, but it does depend on playstyle.

Another fun option may be giving the PCs the choice of stat generation, but at a cost. For example, if a player chooses a variant that yield lower stats, the DM may assign that PC a random bonus, or if a player chooses a variant with higher yielding stats, the DM may assign that PC a random debuff.

This tool attempts to arm DMs with knowledge of how stats are distributed during stat generation based on different sets of house rules, so DMs can make informed decisions with respect to gameplay. There are two graphics generated:
1. Individual Stat Probabilities: This plots the probability of rolling any given stat (multiply by 100 for percent)
2. Cumulative Stat Probabilities: This plots the probability of the value of all stats added together (multiply by 100 for percent)

Both graphics also include the following statistical measures (not to be confused with character stats):
1. Mean: This is a measure of what the average outcome would be from the stat generation
2. Standard Deviation: This measure how widely results vary. A larger value means it varies more, and a smaller value varies less.
3. Skewness: This measure the shape of the results. Roughly, if the peak of the curve is greater than the mean, the skew is negative, and if the peak of the curve is less than the mean, the skew is negative. In the case where the peak is the mean, the skew is zero.
4. Kurtosis: This measure how the rate of how often values that significantly deviate from the mean occur (outliers). Higher values yield more outliers.
